                    We were growing faster than we could keep up. Projects grew larger in scope, and while protocols were thorough, they had many different versions and undocumented alterations.<br><br>
                    They lacked organization, and rather than producing a standard of competence amongst students, their lack of approachability led to an overreliance on mentors and older, independent researchers.<br><br>
                    Highly productive individuals were performing in unorganized environments, and competent people, whose ambition was obvious, were falling victim to cycles of clutter.<br><br>

                    Competent research was decreasing while knowledge grew more concentrated at the top. It wasn't just a knowledge or ability gap causing people to fall behind. There was something deeper.<br><br>
                    Frustration, amongst administrators was increasing as once productive individuals grew apathetic faster than in the past. <br><br>
                    Students were no longer learning, and everybody felt it. Something needed to be done. And with resources spread thin, a restructure was only ever going to come from within.

                    While I was ambitious, there was no feasible way to turn our research stream around alone. While the project began long before there was a dedicated redesign team, no meaningful strides were made until conversations out loud started to emerge.<br><br>

                    Try again. Entropy is a funny thing, and organizations degrade in funny ways. Sometimes full attention is put into protocols when leadership relations is where you should focus.<br><br>
                    When rethinking, rely on the intelligence and experience of others. Look up and down stream. Often issues cascade from other areas rarely explored.<br><br>

                    I sent over the draft to my research educator and got an interesting email back: 'more of this.' I knew what that meant.<br><br>

                    Wet lab and virtual oversaw the redesign of 80+ protocols and rethought research flows. Lecture committee handled all student communication and support materials for the other two committees. Timelines, content, and course policies were subject to deliberation by everyone. <br><br>

                    Committee heads were elected by the entire team day 1. The redesign was a voluntary (and enormous) effort. Each needed the most competent leader to make sure deadlines were met.<br><br>
                    It's still important that less competent individuals sat in committee meetings. Their feedback proved the most beneficial, especially when drafting protocols and policies.<br><br>

                    The team was tasked with redesigning over 80 documents with a fast-approaching next cohort, leaving little room for magic.<br><br>
                    Each committee adopted their own basic design system, placing emphasis on narrative text to make documents more inviting and foster 'big picture' thinking.

                    The committee heads engaged in a thorough reevaluation of the research flow, often adding or removing tens of pages at a time. By the project's conclusion, we successfully shortened the total protocol pages by over fifty, even while improving readability and clarifying explanations in the process.<br><br>

            <p>Throughout history, humans have used art to explore our nature, contemplate the universe, and envision ideals for civilization. </p>
            <p>From cave paintings to classical sculptures and Renaissance masterpieces, fine art has allowed us to deliberate life’s greatest questions. </p>
            <p>Today, much of the creative energy of our era has shifted to new technology. Alluring machines now captivate our collective imagination. We are entranced by the potential of computation, the 21st century's Sistine Chapel.</p>
            <p>This allure is understandable. </p>
            <p>Technology promises to improve life and answer timeless questions about our world. But if not careful, we risk losing the childlike optimism and imagination that continually renews our appreciation for life. </p>
            <p>Like the greatest works of art, great technology, commits to a vision for the future. In every draft, a vote for the world we want to create and leave behind is made. </p>
            <p>da Vinci, Gogh, Mozart, Picasso, and Dalí from a young age had access to usable tools. With just pen and paper, they explored the depths of their curiosity and expression. These tools are timeless. Anyone at any age can use them to create something wonderful. </p>
            <p>The ease of use revolution made tools for computation accessible. My vision extends this ease of use to the development of the tools themselves. We have all used software that we love. Apps, notebooks, and browsers, which through several evolutions have become more personal, friendly, and easy to love. </p>
            <p>But what would a world look like if anyone, at any age, could create tools like these? What if software could be as personal to us as the posters we hang on our walls? I think this world would be even more beautiful and intimate than it is today, especially as more of our life might happen through screens.</p>
            <p>Could your daughter come to you in the fourth grade, not with a finger painting, but with a game she developed in school that day? Could she write her own word processor for high school? Her own application portal for applying to college?</p>
            <p>What does software, the increasing medium of our lives, look like when it doesn't take a genius? </p>
            <p>If my daughter was the one coming to me with these questions, I'd only have one thing to say.</p>
            <p>Think far, stay foolish. </p>
            <p>And so as any great future father, I'll live by my own advice.</p>

            <p>Think Far, Stay Foolish, encourages a sense of futuristic intuition, acute social observation, and a speculative mind.</p>
            <p>It aims to encourages a vision for the world that is foolishly idealistic. As it is only with that foolish optimism, in my belief, that keeps fear at bay long enough to do something worthwhile, to make something wonderful. That spirit, I think, is what creates the kind of pyramiding achievements around us today.</p>
            <p>It's in these first drafts, a 1984 Macintosh or Apple's first spatial computer, that puts on display the virtue of this idealism, selected from and told through an unknown scale of imagination, art, and engineering.</p>
            <p>This spirit of innovation, of principled and yet somehow at the same time foolish exploration, is what compels us to go further. To keep going in spite of the messes we make, our flaws, and our primordial sense of indifference of nature and the world.</p>
            <p>There are votes for the future in every first draft, every design we make.</p>
            <p>Will a spatial computer further optimize computation for keeping attention—or might it help us demystify the world around us? What kind of people will we be in either world in a hundred years? Are we still wonderful?</p>
            <p>These are the kind of hundred year questions that arise if we find the courage to think we could provide good answers to them. And we should try. We should believe that we can. We are the very same people who went to the moon, after all.</p> 
            <p>Our societies, our inventions, are not exhausted of their potential to serve as guiding forces for good. And we would be smart to use our energies to provide what we sense is missing from the world—to give it more dignity.</p>

                    "Home" prioritizes one key function: telling you who's free. Contact sizes distinguish between those who are free and those who are busy. For free friends, a prominent FaceTime button sits right where your fingers naturally rest.<br><br>
                    FTF was built for those special 5-10 loved ones. And they should recieve the same fanfare as movie posters.<br><br>

                    Interviews and focus groups with 31 participants unveiled common obstacles to connect, including forgetfulness, limited free time, and the desire not to burden busy loved ones. <br><br>
                    Many participants revealed that they often gave up reconnecting with friends after just four missed calls, leading to a cycle of diminishing contact, particularly when significant life changes occurred. <br><br>

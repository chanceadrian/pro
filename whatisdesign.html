            <p>Design encompasses the art and science of establishing harmony between humans and invention. </p>
            <p>Our world, due to a variety of factors, poses fundamental challenges to our human experience. Design starts where these challenges begin.</p>
            <div class="story-section">Useful</div>
            <p>The field is inevitably interdisciplinary, as there are an untold number useful things that could improve our lives.</p> 
            <p>Architecture is one of the most mature fields, along with Graphic Design, as shelter and communication were perhaps the most pressing needs at the dawn of civilization. Our world is littered with ideas about how to provide good shelter or communicate effectively. </p>
            <p>Castles, for example, provide protection from the environment and social threats while simultaneously communicating status.</p>
            <p>Design helps us achieve goals by solving problems. Good designs may be considered useful when they satisfy relevant constraints, minimizing costs, and avoiding obstacles.</p>
            <div class="story-section">Familiar</div>
            <p>Designs must also deal with physical, psychological, and aesthetic human constraints.</p> 
            <p>Humans are variable across the world, with a diverse set of accessibility, cultural, and aesthetic standards.</p>
            <p>Designs, if they are to be accepted and consequently used, must be influenced by and even reveal the nature of the people it serves.</p>
            <p>Knowing the characteristics of the people helps designs be familiar, accessible, and easy to love.</p>
            <div class="story-section">Focused</div>
            <p>In societies where new problems of human experience are discovered, created, or articulated on a frequent basis, it is important that designs stay sure of themselves.</p>
            <p>Focused designs may be seen as considerate, non-intrusive, or reliable.</p>
            <p>Designs that are appropriately useful, satisfy the most universal psychological and aesthetic constrains, and focused in my analysis are instant classics.</p>
            <p>They are timeless.</p>
            <p>There is a beauty, a sense of delight, that emerges from products that harmonize across these three principles.</p>
            <p>Whether on purpose or by accident, these designs are just magical.</p>

                    Imagine a creature, a relentless monster, perpetually craving attention. It swiftly grows dull, restless, and even grating to our eyes, relentlessly begging for optimization and constant update. That's color.<br><br>
                    Working with color on this project produced a newfound appreciation for readability, composition, flow, and tones. And just when you think you've understood, a hiding hue comes from nowhere to bite and paralyze you. And it's somehow for the better.<br><br>

                    For reasons yet to be fully understood, it's evident that a significant transformation is on the horizon in health.<br><br>
                    Technology, while remarkable, cannot walk, run, or dance for us. We don't wake up with the same energy every morning; after all, we're not machines. Regarding health, we will require solutions that see beyond our body, that better serve our mind and its many behavioral quirks.<br><br>

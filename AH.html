                    20 structured interviews and surveying 31 participants revealed overwhelming advice diversity, skepticism towards recommendations, and lack of social accountability emerged as the top three obstacles to bettering their health.<br><br>

                    By the time avoidable outcomes are met, it’s too late. Health is often an afterthought, even for those who have put significant effort into it.

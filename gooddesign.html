            <p>What makes good design? According to renowned German industrial designer Dieter Rams, good design should be functional, simple, and timeless. It should be easy to understand, honest, and unobtrusive.</p>
            <p>I love this philosophy, but I'd extend it a bit further. </p>
            <p>Truly innovative design, I think, requires a kind of “cosmic vision,” eyes always on the search for lofty ideas that can further uplift the human spirit and cause.</p>
            <p>It requires a sense for large scale significance, a belief that we are still in the beginning of changing the world—that we as humans deserve better. </p>
            <p>Some say form should follow function, and I don't disagree. But function needs vision.</p>
            <p>Vision is what propels us forward amidst uncertainty and doubt. If we don't offer ours to the world, then something else will. And we can't be sure it will be as palatable to us as what came before.</p>
            <p>Having 'cosmic vision' means having a real respect for greatness, an openness to be transformed by the work of others, and a firm trust in human ingenuity. It means not only respecting genuis, but believing it can be reproduced in our work if we try hard enough, too.</p>
            <p>Our ability to see what is missing is what makes us human. And our ability to bring dreams into reality is what makes us wonderful.</p>
            <p>We must learn history and look to the stars so that they may give us the courage to ask one hundred year questions—and brave enough to provide good answers to them. A world where we seldom ask why is a world much smaller than it should be.</p>
            <p>Every generation has a choice to go to the moon, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to measure and test its energies and skills. </p>
            <p>We cannot afford to forfeit ours.</p>
            <p>That's what it means to have cosmic vision. To be brave enough to carry the weight of the future on your shoulders and feel responsible for your role in shaping it.</p>

            <h6>Ex biologist, Ex machina.</h6>
            <h7>'Deus ex Machina' refers to when an improbable or unexpected event occurs and resolves a plot or situation. My decision to leave biology and pursue design is one such event. While friends of mine worked on Maleria, I redesigned our research lab. I loved research, but I was always more fascinated about how protocols could get more efficient, accurate, and easy to use.</h7>

            <h6>From Biology to Design</h6>
            <h7>Evolutionary biology in my eyes is really just another discipline of design. It's foundations are iteration and webs of interaction. I was taught at various levels of analysis, from the molecular detail to the dynamics of ecosystems the size of continents. Our sense of time and history are cosmic. And the way nature cleverly breaks its own rules is inspiring â€” it's always proving you wrong.</h7>

            <p>I come from a utopian suburbia, located just 45 minutes north of Houston. There is little crime, neighbors are friendly, and everyone works in oil. Children play in the wide streets. Mothers keep tidy, colorful gardens.</p>
            <p>As a kid I made spaceships out of bendaroos and magnets, and obsessively fantasized about space and the future.</p>
            <p>The atmosphere at home was always oriented around doing wonderful things. Nothing was off limits.</p>
            <p>I had an early attraction to the philosophy of science, a deep respect for the idea that truth matters more than consequence.</p>
            <p>So, I chose to study evolutionary biology to understand where we came from and how we got here.</p>
            <p>I emerged from college well read and with an expanded worldview, but I still craved a better way to serve. My undergraduate research was fun and insightful, but I wanted to make the world more wonderful, not work in pharmaceuticals.</p>
            <p>In another life, I might have been a <b>musician</b> (by 17 I was a state-recognized saxophonist), an <b>artist</b> (I'm frequently asked to paint for holiday gifts), a <b>composer</b> (I've written for piano & strings for over a decade), a <b>philosopher</b>  (my undergraduate thesis covered Carl Jung, Charles Darwin, and Camille Paglia), or even a <b>bioengineer</b> (I was due at Johns Hopkins the fall after graduation).</p>
            <p>In the 60s, I would have worked at NASA—the early 20th century, a renowned psychology department.</p>
            <p>I am an optimist who does something about it. I believe in frontiers and in making wonderful things, in a positive future.</p>
            <p>As citizens of the 21st century, we must dare to ask: are we still wonderful? And so I choose design because that is what I believe this century asks of me.</p>
            <p>My name is Chance, and I aim for a future where we can continue to answer "yes," everyday of our lives, where our work exemplifies a shared commitment to a positive future.</p>

                    The time capsule artifact, for example, locks away items with time. This encourages one to leave notes for their future self - a reminder of how far they've come.<br><br>
                    Tunnels help create organized labrynths of self-expression, getting darker and more limited as you progress deeper into a space, encouraging more thoughtful use of space.

                    A lot of time was spent with iconic shapes and timeless mediums, deliberately selecting each curve, material, and shadow. I looked at as many shelves as I could, studying how and why people put things where they do.<br><br>
                    Shelf's iconic shape was modeled after the Arc de Triomphe. In many ways, I wanted a place that felt enormous yet friendly, an entranceway to discovery and intention.

                    The project was born when a friend asked me to dream up a more aesthetic journaling app. I drew the app icon first and simply let the interface creatively emerge out of it.<br><br>
                    It's almost like a second homescreen. A lot of features, like nesting, color changing, and notetaking are already done quite well elsewhere. But Shelf feels more friendly and approachable than anything I've ever seen. <br><br>

                    When questioned about not reconnecting with friends, a surprising finding emerged: Most gave up after around 4 missed calls. <br><br>

                    A lot of time was spent with iconic shapes and timeless mediums, deliberately selecting each curve, material, and shadow. I looked at as many shelves as I could, studying how and why people put things where they do.<br><br>
                    Shelf's iconic shape was modeled after the arc de triomphe. In many ways, I wanted a place that felt enormous yet friendly, an entranceway to discovery and intention.

                    The project was born when a friend asked me to dream up a more aesthetic journaling app. I drew the app icon first and simply let the interface creatively emerge out of it.<br><br>
                    It's almost like a second homescreen. A lot of features, like nesting, color changing, and notetaking are already done quite well elsewhere. But Shelf feels more friendly and approachable than anything I've ever seen. <br><br>
